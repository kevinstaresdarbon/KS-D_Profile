# KS-D_Profile

## Description

I have authored this webpage so that it can serve as a home for my professional portfolio and profile.

I want to have the design and content showcase my proficiency in web-development.

This project helps me to control the look and content of my online profile.

Whilst doing this project I learned how tricky it can be to use media queries to make the content responsive to all viewing devices.
